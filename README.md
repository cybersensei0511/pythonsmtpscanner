## Description

This tool is an SMTP brute force scanner designed for ethical security testing and awareness. It demonstrates how attackers might attempt to gain unauthorized access to email servers by systematically trying different username and password combinations. The tool is intended for educational purposes and should only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Features

- Multi-threaded scanning for efficiency
- Configurable delay between attempts to prevent account lockout
- Supports custom username and password lists
- Saves successful credentials to a file
- Comprehensive error handling
- Command-line interface with extensive options

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethical-smtp-scanner.git
   cd ethical-smtp-scanner

   Usage

   python smtp_brute_scanner.py -t <target> -U <usernames_file> -P <passwords_file> [options]

   Parameters
-t, --target: Target SMTP server address (required)
-p, --port: SMTP port (default: 25)
-U, --usernames: File containing usernames (required)
-P, --passwords: File containing passwords (required)
-o, --output: File to save successful credentials (optional)
--threads: Number of threads (default: 5)
--delay: Delay between attempts in seconds (default: 1)
--timeout: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 10)


Ethical Considerations
This tool is for educational and ethical security testing purposes only. Do not use it on systems you do not own or have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized access is illegal and punishable by law.

By using this tool, you agree to:

Only test systems you are authorized to test.
Use the tool responsibly and with respect for others' privacy and security.
Comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
Prevention Measures
To protect against SMTP brute force attacks, consider the following:

Implement strong password policies.
Use account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed attempts.
Employ multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Monitor logs for unusual activity.
Use intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

## Security Awareness Write-up

### Understanding SMTP Brute Force Attacks

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of email communication. When improperly secured, SMTP servers can become targets for brute force attacks where attackers systematically try to guess login credentials. This tool demonstrates how such attacks work in a controlled, ethical environment.

### How the Attack Works

1. **Reconnaissance**: Attackers identify potential targets using port scanning tools to find open SMTP ports (typically 25, 465, or 587).

2. **Credential Collection**: Attackers gather potential usernames (often through social engineering, data breaches, or enumeration) and password dictionaries.

3. **Systematic Testing**: Using automated tools, attackers attempt to authenticate with different username/password combinations until they find valid credentials.

4. **Exploitation**: Once valid credentials are found, attackers can:
   - Access sensitive email communications
   - Send spam or phishing emails from the compromised account
   - Use the email server as a pivot point for further network attacks
   - Exfiltrate sensitive data

### Real-World Impact

Successful SMTP brute force attacks can lead to:
- Data breaches exposing confidential information
- Financial losses through business email compromise
- Reputational damage to organizations
- Legal and regulatory compliance violations
- Disruption of email services

### Defensive Strategies

Organizations can protect against SMTP brute force attacks by implementing:

1. **Strong Authentication**:
   - Enforce complex password requirements
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   - Regular password rotation policies

2. **Access Controls**:
   - Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
   - IP-based rate limiting
   - Geolocation-based access restrictions

3. **Monitoring and Detection**:
   - Log monitoring for unusual authentication patterns
   - Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
   - Security information and event management (SIEM) solutions

4. **Network Security**:
   - Firewall rules to restrict SMTP access
   - VPN requirements for remote access
   - Segmentation of email servers from other network resources

### The Role of Ethical Security Tools

This scanner serves several important purposes in cybersecurity:

1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Security professionals can use it to test their own systems for weak credentials.

2. **Awareness and Training**: Demonstrates the importance of strong password policies and MFA.

3. **Defense Testing**: Helps organizations evaluate the effectiveness of their security controls.

4. **Educational Value**: Teaches security professionals about attack methodologies and defensive techniques.

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover vulnerabilities using this tool:
1. Document your findings responsibly
2. Report them to the system owner
3. Follow responsible disclosure practices
4. Provide sufficient time for remediation before public disclosure

This project demonstrates not only technical skills but also a strong understanding of ethical security practices, making it a valuable addition to any cybersecurity professional's portfolio.
